## Contributing guidelines

Thank you for considering contribution to this library!

The following text lists guidelines for contributions.
These guidelines don't have legal status, so use them as a reference and common sense - and feel free to update them as well!

### Adding new default phrases

When adding default phrases, please also provide (stable) references where
others established a common understanding of what is to be avoided and to be used instead.
Ideally, such references also describe why the phrase needs replacement as not everyone may understand the cultural implications.

See the existing reference examples of large companies or institutions for instance.

I mean this tool to help follow established guidelines within communities, not to be the place to discuss them.
This, because I neither have the training, expertise, nor the energy to keep up in such discussions.
